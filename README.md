## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **data analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data** using **Python** in **Google Colab**. It demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and deriving meaningful insights using **pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib**.

The dataset was sourced from [this public URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SR1608/Datasets/main/covid-data.csv).

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Perform high-level and low-level exploratory data analysis
- Clean and transform raw data
- Create new features for better insight extraction
- Visualize patterns in the spread of COVID-19 across continents
- Derive insights on key indicators like GDP per capita, HDI, and mortality ratios

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Google Colab 📒
- Pandas 🧾
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 📈

## 📂 Project Steps

### 1. 📥 Data Import and Exploration
- Loaded data directly from URL using pandas
- Checked shape, types, null values, and statistical summary

### 2. 🔍 High-Level Analysis
- **Rows & Columns**: 1,213,879 entries, 45 features
- **Data types** and distributions were evaluated using `describe()` and `info()`

### 3. 🧬 Low-Level Understanding
- 216 unique locations
- **Europe** has the highest data representation
- Max total cases: `55,154,651`
- Avg total cases: `167,797`
- **HDI highest** in Europe
- **Lowest GDP per capita** in Africa

### 4. 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Filtered to key columns: `['continent', 'location', 'date', 'total_cases', 'total_deaths', 'gdp_per_capita', 'human_development_index']`
- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values (filled with `0`, removed rows with missing continent)
- Converted date to datetime and extracted month

### 5. 🔎 Data Aggregation & Feature Engineering
- Grouped data by `continent`
- Created a new feature: `total_deaths_to_total_cases`

## 📊 Data Visualizations & Insights

### 📌 1. GDP per Capita - Distribution
```python
sns.histplot(df['gdp_per_capita'], kde=True)
````

📝 **Insight**: Most countries have a GDP per capita below 20,000. A few wealthy outliers heavily influence the distribution.

---

### 📌 2. Total Cases vs GDP per Capita

```python
sns.scatterplot(x='total_cases', y='gdp_per_capita', data=df)
```

📝 **Insight**: No clear correlation. Wealthy countries don't necessarily have fewer cases, suggesting pandemic spread is independent of economic status.

---

### 📌 3. Pairplot of Aggregated Data

```python
sns.pairplot(df_groupby)
```

📝 **Insight**: Exploratory view of relationship between total cases, total deaths, GDP, and HDI across continents.

---

### 📌 4. Total Cases by Continent

```python
sns.catplot(x='continent', y='total_cases', data=df_groupby, kind='bar')
```

📝 **Insight**: **Europe** had the highest number of total cases, followed by **Asia** and **North America**.

## 📈 Outcome Summary

| Metric                  | Insight                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Highest Cases           | Europe (55M+)                            |
| Avg Cases per Country   | \~167k                                   |
| Quartiles (Deaths)      | Q1: 13, Q2: 84, Q3: 727                  |
| HDI Leader              | Europe                                   |
| Lowest GDP per Capita   | Africa                                   |
| Mortality Ratio Insight | High death-to-case ratio suggests strain |
